# CBregress
This is a R package to fit a latent variable regression model.

# Objective
In cases when both variables _x,y_ are measured with error, linear regression will estimate the slope biased to 0. One general procedure that may do better is orthogonal regression. Another one is used here: Case based latent regression. It is especially powerful when the variables are not normally distributed.
